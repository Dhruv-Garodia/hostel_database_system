# Hostel Management System

#### Preamble

The main intention to make this project was to help the hostel administration maintain a record and keep track of all the children they are taking care of and the employees working for the system . Their current primeval system of maintaining a physical record of all the people , was way too hectic for both the students and the support staff , as both had to fill in long detail sheets for records. They will be able to retrieve , insert , modify and delete data in a much more efficient and safe way. Efficiency is increased by making use of triggers , stored triggers , functions to minimise info that needs to be entered by the end user. Safety will be guaranteed due to use of constraints and the inherent recovery system.

I have tried to reduce manual labor and help the administration maintain better records for the students and employees. My system also has the feature to keep a track of the visitors visiting their beloved living in the hostel. To add to the feature list and application, we also help maintain a record of the number of rooms in each building (block) in our hostel and the rooms allocated to a student.
	
As the hostel also provides us with cloak room service to keep our valuables , with a monthly subscription policy , in case we are going out on a semester break or a vacation . We help maintain which room has been rented by whom and for what duration.
